# Specification Quality Checklist: nf-slack Notification Plugin

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS

- **No implementation details**: PASS - Specification avoids specific technologies and focuses on capabilities. FR-014 mentions "Slack Block Kit" which is the required Slack message format, not an implementation choice.
- **User value focused**: PASS - All user stories clearly describe user needs and business value
- **Stakeholder accessible**: PASS - Written in plain language without technical jargon
- **Mandatory sections**: PASS - All required sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness - PASS

- **No clarification markers**: PASS - Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in the specification
- **Testable requirements**: PASS - All 20 functional requirements are specific and testable (e.g., "MUST send Slack notifications on workflow start events")
- **Measurable success criteria**: PASS - All 10 success criteria include specific metrics (e.g., "within 5 seconds", "95% success rate", "90% satisfaction")
- **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: PASS - Success criteria focus on user outcomes and timings, not implementation details
- **Acceptance scenarios defined**: PASS - Each of 3 user stories has 4 acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format
- **Edge cases identified**: PASS - 6 edge cases documented covering error conditions, limits, and concurrent usage
- **Scope bounded**: PASS - Clear focus on Slack notifications via webhook, explicit exclusion of other notification channels
- **Assumptions documented**: PASS - 9 assumptions listed covering webhook format, permissions, connectivity, and defaults

### Feature Readiness - PASS

- **Requirements with acceptance criteria**: PASS - All functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- **User scenarios cover flows**: PASS - Three prioritized user stories cover core automatic notifications (P1), custom messages (P2), and customization (P3)
- **Measurable outcomes defined**: PASS - Success criteria define specific, measurable targets for each capability
- **No implementation leakage**: PASS - Specification maintains focus on what and why, not how (with exception of Slack Block Kit which is the required message protocol)

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- All quality checks passed on first validation
- No issues requiring spec updates
- The mention of "Slack Block Kit" in FR-014 is appropriate as it's the required protocol for formatted Slack messages, not an implementation choice
